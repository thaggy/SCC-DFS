# SCC-DFS
Strongly Connected Components by DFS

This can be reads from a .txt file
the format of the .txt file should be as follows
VERTEX# VERTEX#
VERTEX# VERTEX#
etc.
The graphs given must be written as a directed graph so if for example I had,
4 5
3 2
4 would connect to 5 but 5 would not connect to four and the same for 3 and 2

This program will find the strongly connected components using DFS in O(V+E) time which is the fastest efficiency possible for SCC
